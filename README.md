# Introduction To ReactJS: Workshop

React is a front-end library developed by Facebook. It's used for handling the 
view layer for Website, Native Mobile Apps and VR. ReactJS allows you to create 
reusable UI components. It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript 
libraries out there. With a strong foundation and a large community behind it.

In this workshop, we will learn how to build a component-based web-app using ReactJS.


## Requirements

Please make sure, you've the following items installed on your laptop before the event, 
for the workshop.

1. Google Chrome

2. Node v9.4+, NPM v5.6+, Yarn v1.3+

   - [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
   - [Installing Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

3. Node Dependencies

   Install the **create-react-app** dependence.

   ```bash
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

4. Code Editor, of your choice

If you're unable to use Node or its dependencies. You can instead use 
[CodeSandbox]( https://codesandbox.io) as a fallback option, in your browser.

For anyone, who needs a refresher on JavaScript. I recommend you read the excellent 
[Re-introduction guide to JavaScript]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript).


## Workshop

Please run `yarn install` to install the project dependancies before getting started.

- **Starting Version**

  Use the `master` branch to start building out the app.

- **Completed Version**

  The completed version is the end product we'll be working towards. You can get a 
  look at it by checking out the `completed` branch.
